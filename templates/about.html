                        my name is seina assadian. i was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on the 22nd of may, 2000.
                        growing up, i always had an interest in technology. considering my dad is a software engineering,
                        i feel like that interest came from him. i started teaching myself programming in elemntary school â€”
                        during the 6th grade science fair to be exact. immediately, i was hooked. as a kid, i loved video games.
                        in fact, i could barely keep my eyes off a screen. so, finding out that programming offered the possibility
                        to create my own games, it was a dream come true. i kept teaching myself programming through tutorials i
                        found online until high school, where i took my first programming course. from then on, i decided i wanted
                        to continue my education in this field. in cegep, i studied computer science and maths, and going on to university
                        i began my bachelors of software engineering.
                    </p>

                        while technology and programming has always been one of my biggest passions, art and music have always held
                        a special place in my heart. i enjoy playing and listening to music, drawing, designing and creating. in fact,
                        if not for software engineering i would have probably gone into a design program.
